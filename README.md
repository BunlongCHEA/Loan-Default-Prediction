# Loan-Default-Prediction
Practical Project 
Lending Club is a P2P online service of lending money between investors and borrowers or businesses:
1. Investor can earn risk-adjusted return, to help them determining whether the risk taken was worth the expected reward.
2. Investor can assess risk and review loan application of borrower provided by Lending Club (LC)
3. Investor receive offer in just a minute with no impact credit score.
4. Investor can earn monthly returns.

However, according to this setting, investors can easily make wrong decision to give loan:
1. The borrowers receive the loan even if they donâ€™t have ability to return the money.
2. The borrowers or businesses might go bankruptcy without any payment.
3. The borrowers have government tax-debt or other debt.

To avoid these risk, LC conduct a set of exploratory analysis to identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.
